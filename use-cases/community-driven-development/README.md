# Community-driven development

One of the main focuses of Ever Plaftorm team is to help blockchain developer ecosystem grow.&#x20;

For that, besides providing free APIs and tools, we need to <mark style="color:green;">**develop strong feedback loop from Dev Community**</mark>.

To enable that we provide:

* [public Ever Platform roadmap](roadmap/)
* [social channels where developers can discuss and influence the roadmap](roadmap/discussions.md)
