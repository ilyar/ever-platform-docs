# Web Playground

**Test your queries and explore blockchain data**

GraphQL web playground is available for each network at its root endpoint URL. See the [previous section](networks.md) for more details.

The general address convention is `endpoint/graphql`

Use the playground to enter queries in the left side and get response in the right side. We have video tutorials showing how to use the playground.
